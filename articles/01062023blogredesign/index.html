<p>I had trouble sleeping tonight, so I decided to redesign the blog
part of my website using as little css as possible <strong>AND</strong>
create a workflow wherein I can create new articles by writing a single
markdown file and just converting to HTML. Yes, of course, I am fully
aware of all the static site generators out there, but for some reason
(absolute stupidity and laziness on my part), when I started this blog,
I decided to write articles manually using a HTML template that I
gobbled up together. For a while it was okay, but now that I want to
just dump more things on here — and it was proving to be incredibly
ineffecient and very much prone to a lot of broken links and
unmaintainability.</p>

after writing this short blog post, I was done with manually doing
it<br />
<br />
<br />
I mean… the old crusty page looked okay, as you can see I don’t really
care about how this site looks, I just want it to work and be as minimal
as possible and a place where people can read things that I am enthused
to learn, opinions, and ya’ know… stuff.<br />
<br />
I came across this for the dark mode device recognition:<br />
</p>
<p><code>&lt;meta name="color-scheme" content="light dark"&gt;</code></p>
<p>Which I think it’s pretty cool that it doesn’t even need to use <span
class="citation" data-cites="media">@media</span> css arguments.</p>
<p>and then I played around with pandoc and made <a
href="https://github.com/kj-sh604/makefile-blog-article">this
Makefile</a> to compile markdown to a usable HTML output — which
streamlines the process.</p>
<p>Also! with the simpler design it makes it easier to manipulate pandoc
css styling (for the few things you do need css for)</p>

Looks like crap, but! it works and it makes things easy for me — in
light mode</p>
<p>so yeah! you’re most definitely seeing the new one now and the old
one is not coming back. This is more simple, plain, and actually
suprisingly readable.</p>
<p>yeah… rss feed coming soon. I’m definitely going to rewrite this,
because I’m so sleepy I’m writing this with one eye open.<br />
