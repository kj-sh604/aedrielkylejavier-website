I am now hosting copies of the GNU Troff Manual and cat-V. Nothing really super interesting with this decisionâ€¦ cat-V seems to have neglected their SSL certificates. I assume they think it's "bloat" ðŸ˜‚ and I am currently trying to improve my skills in `groff`, hence, I now have a copy of the manual on here as well which can be found:

### âœ¨ [Here](groff) âœ¨

**Cool!** come learn this stuff with meâ€¦

***Oh Shoot*** I forgot about the cat-V thingâ€¦ that'll be here:

### âœ¨ [Here](../../cat-v) âœ¨
