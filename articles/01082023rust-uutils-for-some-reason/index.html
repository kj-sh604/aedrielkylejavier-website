<h1 class="title">Replaced the GNU <code>coreutils</code> with the
<code>rust-uutils</code> on All My Linux Machines</h1>

<meta name="color-scheme" content="light dark">
<p>I’ll be honest… this was a very impulsive decision from around 6
months ago when I found the <code>coreutils-hybrid</code> package in the
AUR. It’s nothing more than a hybrid package which uses stable
rust-uutils programs mixed with GNU counterparts if the uutils
counterpart are unfinished/buggy. I don’t really know what draws my
interest to the rust-uuils, maybe it was the initial assumption that the
utilitles were <strong><em>strictly POSIX-compliant</em></strong>, which
I later discovered that they were not.</p>
<p>Why am I interested in <strong><em>strict
POSIX-Compliance</em></strong>? well… I don’t know either, maybe it’s
all the people that try my scripts on macOS and it straight up doesn’t
work because I wasn’t aware of what “GNU-isms” were at the time 🤦🏽‍♂️ 😂 .
As you can see, there is really no substance to the decision 😅 but for
some reason, I did it anyway.</p>
<p><a href="rust-uutils.mp4"><img src="rust-uutils.webp"
alt="rust-uutils video" /></a></p>
<p>As seen in the video, it doesn’t use all of the rust-uutils (cp was
still its GNU version) and I’ll be honest… as I’ve used my system for
the normal gen-Z stuff, I totally forgot I made this change. I guess
that goes to show how usable and seamless the <code>rust-uutils</code>
are.</p>
<p>I, then decided to take this a step further by adding the following
aliases to my <code>fish</code> config:</p>
<pre><code>
    # Command Substitutions 
        alias echo=&quot;uu-echo&quot;
        alias ls=&quot;uu-ls --group-directories-first -h -p --color -F&quot;
        alias pwd=&quot;uu-pwd&quot;
        alias groups=uu-groups
        alias kill=uu-kill
        alias ln=uu-ln

        ## Experimental/Risky rust-uutits Substitutions for Testing
        alias basenc=uu-basenc
        alias date=uu-date
        alias false=uu-false
        alias hostname=uu-hostname
        alias join=uu-join
        alias pathchk=uu-pathchk
        alias realpath=uu-realpath
        alias tail=uu-tail
        alias touch=uu-touch
        alias true=uu-true
        alias uptime=uu-uptime

        # Plan9 Utils Command Substitutions
        alias sort=&quot;9 sort&quot;
        alias grep=&quot;9 grep&quot;


</code></pre>
<p>So now, I’m using even more of the rust-uutils (at least on an
interactive shell) and so far it has been very seamless that on most
days I forget I’m even running this, until I need to search for an
argument with <code>--help</code> or the <code>man</code> page.</p>
<p>I’ll continue to report on this, but as of right now this has been
very much viable without any distinguishable differences with the GNU
coreutils. Granted, I have not tested performance nor have I written
very complex <code>sh</code> scripts in the past few months, but for a
daily Linux computer intended to be used like a “<em>normie</em>” pretty
f**king good and more than usable 👌🏽.</p>
<p>My <strong><code>GNU/Linux</code></strong> system is slowly becoming
<strong><code>uutils/Linux</code></strong> 😂 now we just need a rust
re-write of glibc, gdb, and binutils 😅</p>
