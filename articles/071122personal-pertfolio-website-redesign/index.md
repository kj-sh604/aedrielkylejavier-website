Had some time to do a redesign on my personal website, today 😌. I did
my best to \"decrease the clutter\" and make viewer experience more
\"streamlined\".

I am a big fan of \"no-bloat\" webpages as I have noticed modern
websites tend to use a lot unnecessary \"fluff\" that lead to slower
page load times and increased CPU usage on the client-side, due to the
use of large CSS libraries and redundant javascript execution. I am
passionate about web access in third-world/developing countries (wherein
bandwidth can be limited), this is why I prefer to build useful and
functional --- yet minimal websites.

Overall footprint of the site is only at 0.96 MiB (and yes, that
includes the pictures and other graphics on the page). It uses \"sane\"
CSS written from scratch and \"libré\" javascript.

I think the original \"Web 1.0 inspired\" design of the site has looked
very dated (obviously) so I settled on redesigning it with the focus on
modern mobile devices, while still keeping its old-school \"web 1.0\"
simplicity when it came to how it was built. Needed improvements to
navigability and viewer experience were also focused on 👍🏽.
