I will admit that Doug\'s scoring system does have its flaws but if you
actually look at his DougScore chart, you can have a pretty decent grasp
on how he does his scoring\... I think it\'s a scoring system based on a
\"what if\" --- being the viewer will be (hypothetically) purchasing the
car he\'s currently reviewing, and then he breaks it down if it\'ll be a
good daily car or good weekend car based on what you look for in a car
in the modern day. If u keep that in mind, you\'ll see that his chart
makes a lot more sense. OF COURSE a 2018 BMW M5 will have a higher score
than some clean Honda Civic Si, EVEN THOUGH he was (kinda) visibly more
excited with the Civic because of all of the nostalgia, hot-hatchback
heritage, and rarity (condition-wise) of the vehicle; with that said,
based on (how I perceive) his scoring works he would definitely score
the BMW M5 high because it will be the better buy for anybody in the
market for a car RIGHT NOW.

Nostalgia, praise, and excitement will not always yield a high dougscore
because those aren\'t necessarily things that would be deciding factors
in a current day car purchase. So Doug might have such high praise and
excitement for a light and bare-essential Civic Si and how fun and
\"go-karty\" it was to drive, but obviously a Civic Si with just the
bare essentials is not something you would buy today if u could buy an
BMW M5 (even though Doug was more vanilla, rehearsed, and technical in
that review rather than excited and praiseful), but that\'s just my
perspective and opinion about the whole thing. I mean, he did write
columns for AutoTrader after all...
