*Essay Prompt: You discovered you are good (or bad) at something but you weren't supposed to be because of your sex: you are a man but you sure can knit a mean sweater, decorate a living room, write poetry and make jewelry. You are a woman but you sure are good at deep sea fishing, boxing, physics, working on your boyfriend's car and you can design a building in a single bound. How did this construct your identity as a woman or a man?*

The early 2000s, cassettes on the floor, CDs in the car, and really big
computer monitors and Televisions. I was four years old and just
discovering the world and its idiosyncrasies. Young, curious, and in the
midst of exploration to what the world has to offer. I would consider my
family very much traditional --- we have a father to provide a "pillar"
for provision, discipline, and familial work-ethic. We grew up with a
wonderful mother fitting the typical clichÃ© of "Light of the Home", a
pillar of our emotional quotient, nurturing, and affection. The father
was taking care of the more "tough" and "logical" skills to be thought
to us as children. Maybe how to handle a wrench, change a spare tire,
and fix some basic plumbing. While the mother, takes care of the more
"emotional", "spiritual", and mental wisdom that is needed in this
world. May it be how to deal with heartbreak, how to handle grief, and
how it's always okay to validate your own emotions. Growing up, I was
very close with my mother. As much as, I was raised to be "traditionally
masculine" wherein toughness and grit has always been glorified, my
mother has always been there to balance out the need for the "softer"
and more "feminine" side of one's self.

As I have grown and explored the world in the years to come, I was very
much "a boy". I would play with Hot Wheels, Pro-Wrestling Action
Figures, and I even had a favorite \"sandok\" ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­ growing up that I would
take with me to bed and let it "sleep" beside me. I was into sports, I
loved watching basketball and when I finally grew over 5'11" I became
(albeit a little bit undersized) a varsity basketball player. I would
get rowdy, get into fights, and do a lot of stupid decisions. As the
saying goes, "boys would be boys" and I was very much a part of that
group targeted by the clichÃ©. My assumption to the causation of my
adolescent "traditionally masculine" personality is that I was in an
environment wherein my upbringing was very much traditional and
old-school, hence, I became more of the prototypical male growing up.
Especially as I have spent more time learning skills and attributes from
my father during my developmental years.

I have never really questioned my gender identity nor my sexual
orientation; however, even in my "traditionally masculine" personality,
I was never really afraid to do or express anything that would be
labeled as "traditionally feminine" either. Again, growing up close to a
mother with a very high emotional quotient, I was never afraid to cry
and express vulnerability. The saying of "you
[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_]{.underline} like a girl" just never made sense, as
my mother was a strong role model for me in-terms of emotional
intelligence. Which is why I became fully open to the fact that I also
love to appreciate more classically feminine endeavors like musical
theatre, softer romantic films, expressions of emotions like poetry and
monologues. Even having a decent level of knowledge when it came to
women's fashion and make-up, despite being, a "traditionally masculine"
straight male. I love understanding emotions, deep conversations,
vulnerabilities, and many other psychological interests. Now as the
essay prompt centers on "How did this construct affect your identity as
a woman or a man?", I say it impacted me very little. I never really
perceived that as a male with some feminine interests should make me
rethink my construct as a person. I was simply a male who was able to
get in-touch with his grittier and more rugged masculine side and his
more feminine and emotionally strong side. The causation of which, can
be appointed to my traditional upbringing wherein I can find security in
both sides of my humanity, without having to waiver in my security and
identity as a person. Men can have feminine traits too, and women can
have masculine traits as well.

Identity goes deeper and beyond than just our traits.
