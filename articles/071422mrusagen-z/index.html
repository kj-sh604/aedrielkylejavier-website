        <strong>Client
          Name:</strong>
        Urbain Sam Anderson (One
        of the Many Descendants of the Uncle Sam family-tree)</p>
      <p><strong>Address:</strong>
        0704 Silent Majority Dr. NW, Baltimore, MD 20500
      </p>
      <p><strong>Description
          of Client:</strong>
        Urbain Sam Anderson was born on July 4<sup>th</sup>,
        1998. He is the first of the Uncle Sam family-tree to be born in the
        “Zoomer Generation” or what is more commonly called
        “Generation-Z”. He was born into very strong traditions, beliefs,
        and embedded cultures of his family. He arrives at my office today
        comfortably dressed, and very much young and spry. However, I was
        keen to notice that despite a mirage of positivity in his eyes there
        seems to be a level of anxiety that emanates from his aura. What can
        be described as a “lost soul within”. We sat down at the top of
        the hour and have grown closer in conversation. As we talked, he
        opened up a lot more, I started to see that positive frame fade and a
        sense of being loss and confused starts to creep out.</p>
      <p><strong>Presenting
          Problem:</strong>
        Mr. Anderson made this appointment in light of many recent patterns
        that he notices in the social landscape where he resides. Society for
        many of Mr. Anderson’s peers has been associated and even centered
        on what has been going on social media. He feels like he lost crucial
        critical thinking abilities that he had when he was growing up.
        Especially, when it came to thinking about social issues and
        different poles of the political spectrum. He explains that he feels
        like “social media does the thinking for us now and I feel like my
        generation is fearful to go against the mainstream”. He also states
        that there now emanates a social anxiety when politics or
        controversial issues are brought up. Everything seem to become more
        political nowadays and polar extremes from each other are drifting
        farther away. For Mr. Anderson, things are becoming more and more
        black and white in society, polar opposites, and he fears that if he
        can’t choose a side, he would get loss in the cross-fire.
        Unfortunately, he also feels that if the country he lives in
        continues to be divided and have said crossfire, that solving key
        issues in the country are less likely to be resolved.</p>
      <p><strong>History</strong>:
        Mr. Anderson, growing up in the early 00’s, social media wasn’t
        even something imagined by people living in those times. For the most
        part, Mr. Anderson had a very similar childhood to the generations
        before him, played outside with friends. When he was bored, he would
        talk with his parents or play with physical toys, and still very much
        be imaginative with the things that he was dealing with on a daily
        basis. He explains that he notices the differences of life now,
        compared to the life before social media. He states “it seems like
        as we gathered more information, we’ve loss more meaning”</p>
      <p><strong>Personality
          and Character Structure:</strong>
        The client seems to no longer know what they value. Mr. Anderson grew
        up with parents and family members who value the typical US
        traditions of being patriotic, fighting for freedom, and the value of
        the “We The People” moniker. These are considered the more
        prominent beliefs from the Baby Boomer and Millennial generation of
        people. He considers this very much “Nationalist” and pro-USA in
        his perspective and in some ways Mr. Anderson still very much values
        some these traditions and concepts. However, in light of recent
        events, and a strong uproar from voices in social media in regards to
        the true and unfortunate events with Cases of Police Brutality (like
        with George Floyd), the prominence of unequal rights, and the
        Overturning of Roe V. Wade that are often validly associated with the
        polar-right as the culprit for such unfortunate and hurtful events.
        Mr. Anderson now also sees the rationale and grounds for the strong
        beliefs of the polar-left, which are often seen as ideals against
        American Norms. Mr. Anderson finds that his beliefs often lies in the
        center or in a neutral state. For some social issues he may lean a
        little bit “right winged” and for some issues he may lean a
        little “left winged”. He mentions that he finds trouble from the<i>
          Ad hominems</i>
        that he sees on social media and even sometimes are directed to him.
        The<i>
          Ad Hominens </i>that
        he shared are in the nature of “If your stance is not consistently
        associated with the side of the political spectrum that I support,
        then you must be part of the political wing that I dislike” which
        he sees as very black and white, and leads to a way of thinking that
        requires you to either put a “right-winged” or “left-winged”
        lens first before evaluating different social, political, and even
        medical issues. Mr. Anderson finds this problematic as now we lose
        the “<i>Tabula
          rasa</i>”
        way of critical thinking, which is to think of something from a blank
        slate. He claims himself as “centrist” which he described to now
        seem to be a Capital Sin from the left and the right in social media.
        Mr. Anderson also feels like a lot of his generation are actually
        silently in this camp, confused and lost as well, but they fear to
        vocalize these feelings on social media (a very important aspect of
        life in Generation-Z) because they feel like they would be attacked
        or persuaded by the people from either the left or right wings of the
        political scale.</p>
      <p><strong>Diagnosis:</strong>
        Client seems to be overly-emersed in conversations, narratives, and
        debates on social media wherein in creates a level of anxiety and
        confusion within themselves. The client puts a high level of value
        and even associates actual society with what is happening in social
        media.</p>
      <p><strong>Personal
          Strength: </strong>Mr.
        Anderson is very rational in his way of thinking and despite his
        fears of being confused and lost, he is actually very much self-aware
        of himself and has a relatively good grasp of questioning things that
        are going on around him. This is often seen as the first-step when it
        comes to resolving problem likes these and Mr. Anderson already has
        the first step covered (at least when it comes to the trait of having
        such).</p>
      <p><strong>Treatment
          Plan: </strong>A
        good treatment plan for Mr. Anderson would be to do a detox from
        social media as these have been one of the main sources of his
        anxiety. Especially, as political conversations are very much rampant
        at present time (for good reason). He fears that he lost a lot of his
        critical thinking abilities, so a good course of action for this,
        would be to write out his thoughts on a daily-basis that are not
        influenced by media of any sort, just his own thoughts about issues
        that he thinks are important —amongst other things, and nothing
        more. As days in the treatment progress, Mr. Anderson should continue
        to reread his work from the day before so that he can rehear his
        thoughts in his head. I also encourage Mr. Anderson to create social
        connections outside of social media, have deep conversations (beyond
        small talk) to an elderly person at a restaurant, to a young person
        that he may see walking down the sidewalk, and try to connect with
        people who came from outside the United States. This may help the
        client disassociate his social reality from social media and more so
        equate it with what he sees in real life. This would help Mr.
        Anderson create tangible interactions and perspectives, that in turn,
        would also help him form his own perspective and beliefs, detached
        from the stronger voices found on social media. I also encourage Mr.
        Anderson to research on “political spectrum and compass” which is
        a more common distinction in other countries, unlike in the United
        States where politics is often a line (left, center, and right).</p>
      <p><strong>Progress
          Milestones: </strong>As
        the client improves, they should feel a level of assurance within
        themselves and more security in their beliefs as a person whether or
        not that falls “right, left, or center” of the political meter.
        They should also feel a “detach” from the need for validation of
        these opinions from social media. As we build personal security with
        Mr. Anderson we can slowly reintroduce social media to him and see if
        old feelings of anxiety would return. If a stronger sense of self is
        created from the treatment, limited social media interaction may be
        allowed.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Prognosis:
        </strong>Improvements
        in overall esteem, mental health, and wellness should also be seen as
        a main cause of anxiety is removed. A level of sureness will
        hopefully be developed as the client emerges from therapy and a more
        positive outlook on life may be a good effect as well. As the
        therapist, or any other future doctor who would take on this case,
        may we be hands-on and encouraging to Mr. Anderson just like how we
        would be with clients that have similar feelings of anxiety and fear.
