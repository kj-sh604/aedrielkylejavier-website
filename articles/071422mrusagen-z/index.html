<p><strong>The Voices of Generation-Z’s Silent Majority in the United
States</strong></p>
<p><em>(Warning: This academic writing is slightly political in
nature)</em></p>
<p><em>Inspired by the Writing with a Similar Title <a

<p><br />
<strong>Client Name:</strong> Urbain Sam Anderson (One of the Many
Descendants of the Uncle Sam family-tree)</p>
<p><strong>Address:</strong> 0704 Silent Majority Dr. NW, Baltimore, MD
20500</p>
<p><strong>Description of Client:</strong> Urbain Sam Anderson was born
on July 4<sup>th</sup>, 1998. He is the first of the Uncle Sam
family-tree to be born in the “Zoomer Generation” or what is more
commonly called “Generation-Z”. He was born into very strong traditions,
beliefs, and embedded cultures of his family. He arrives at my office
today comfortably dressed, and very much young and spry. However, I was
keen to notice that despite a mirage of positivity in his eyes there
seems to be a level of anxiety that emanates from his aura. What can be
described as a “lost soul within”. We sat down at the top of the hour
and have grown closer in conversation. As we talked, he opened up a lot
more, I started to see that positive frame fade and a sense of being
loss and confused starts to creep out.</p>
<p><strong>Presenting Problem:</strong> Mr. Anderson made this
appointment in light of many recent patterns that he notices in the
social landscape where he resides. Society for many of Mr. Anderson’s
peers has been associated and even centered on what has been going on
social media. He feels like he lost crucial critical thinking abilities
that he had when he was growing up. Especially, when it came to thinking
about social issues and different poles of the political spectrum. He
explains that he feels like “social media does the thinking for us now
and I feel like my generation is fearful to go against the mainstream”.
He also states that there now emanates a social anxiety when politics or
controversial issues are brought up. Everything seem to become more
political nowadays and polar extremes from each other are drifting
farther away. For Mr. Anderson, things are becoming more and more black
and white in society, polar opposites, and he fears that if he can’t
choose a side, he would get loss in the cross-fire. Unfortunately, he
also feels that if the country he lives in continues to be divided and
have said crossfire, that solving key issues in the country are less
likely to be resolved.</p>
<p><strong>History</strong>: Mr. Anderson, growing up in the early 00’s,
social media wasn’t even something imagined by people living in those
times. For the most part, Mr. Anderson had a very similar childhood to
the generations before him, played outside with friends. When he was
bored, he would talk with his parents or play with physical toys, and
still very much be imaginative with the things that he was dealing with
on a daily basis. He explains that he notices the differences of life
now, compared to the life before social media. He states “it seems like
as we gathered more information, we’ve loss more meaning”</p>
<p><strong>Personality and Character Structure:</strong> The client
seems to no longer know what they value. Mr. Anderson grew up with
parents and family members who value the typical US traditions of being
patriotic, fighting for freedom, and the value of the “We The People”
moniker. These are considered the more prominent beliefs from the Baby
Boomer and Millennial generation of people. He considers this very much
“Nationalist” and pro-USA in his perspective and in some ways Mr.
Anderson still very much values some these traditions and concepts.
However, in light of recent events, and a strong uproar from voices in
social media in regards to the true and unfortunate events with Cases of
Police Brutality (like with George Floyd), the prominence of unequal
rights, and the Overturning of Roe V. Wade that are often validly
associated with the polar-right as the culprit for such unfortunate and
hurtful events. Mr. Anderson now also sees the rationale and grounds for
the strong beliefs of the polar-left, which are often seen as ideals
against American Norms. Mr. Anderson finds that his beliefs often lies
in the center or in a neutral state. For some social issues he may lean
a little bit “right winged” and for some issues he may lean a little
“left winged”. He mentions that he finds trouble from the <em>Ad
hominems</em> that he sees on social media and even sometimes are
directed to him. The <em>Ad Hominens</em> that he shared are in the
nature of “If your stance is not consistently associated with the side
of the political spectrum that I support, then you must be part of the
political wing that I dislike” which he sees as very black and white,
and leads to a way of thinking that requires you to either put a
“right-winged” or “left-winged” lens first before evaluating different
social, political, and even medical issues. Mr. Anderson finds this
problematic as now we lose the “<em>Tabula rasa</em>” way of critical
thinking, which is to think of something from a blank slate. He claims
himself as “centrist” which he described to now seem to be a Capital Sin
from the left and the right in social media. Mr. Anderson also feels
like a lot of his generation are actually silently in this camp,
confused and lost as well, but they fear to vocalize these feelings on
social media (a very important aspect of life in Generation-Z) because
they feel like they would be attacked or persuaded by the people from
either the left or right wings of the political scale.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis:</strong> Client seems to be overly-emersed in
conversations, narratives, and debates on social media wherein in
creates a level of anxiety and confusion within themselves. The client
puts a high level of value and even associates actual society with what
is happening in social media.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Strength:</strong> Mr. Anderson is very rational in
his way of thinking and despite his fears of being confused and lost, he
is actually very much self-aware of himself and has a relatively good
grasp of questioning things that are going on around him. This is often
seen as the first-step when it comes to resolving problem likes these
and Mr. Anderson already has the first step covered (at least when it
comes to the trait of having such).</p>
<p><strong>Treatment Plan:</strong> A good treatment plan for
Mr. Anderson would be to do a detox from social media as these have been
one of the main sources of his anxiety. Especially, as political
conversations are very much rampant at present time (for good reason).
He fears that he lost a lot of his critical thinking abilities, so a
good course of action for this, would be to write out his thoughts on a
daily-basis that are not influenced by media of any sort, just his own
thoughts about issues that he thinks are important —amongst other
things, and nothing more. As days in the treatment progress,
Mr. Anderson should continue to reread his work from the day before so
that he can rehear his thoughts in his head. I also encourage
Mr. Anderson to create social connections outside of social media, have
deep conversations (beyond small talk) to an elderly person at a
restaurant, to a young person that he may see walking down the sidewalk,
and try to connect with people who came from outside the United States.
This may help the client disassociate his social reality from social
media and more so equate it with what he sees in real life. This would
help Mr. Anderson create tangible interactions and perspectives, that in
turn, would also help him form his own perspective and beliefs, detached
from the stronger voices found on social media. I also encourage
Mr. Anderson to research on “political spectrum and compass” which is a
more common distinction in other countries, unlike in the United States
where politics is often a line (left, center, and right).</p>
<p><strong>Progress Milestones:</strong> As the client improves, they
should feel a level of assurance within themselves and more security in
their beliefs as a person whether or not that falls “right, left, or
center” of the political meter. They should also feel a “detach” from
the need for validation of these opinions from social media. As we build
personal security with Mr. Anderson we can slowly reintroduce social
media to him and see if old feelings of anxiety would return. If a
stronger sense of self is created from the treatment, limited social
media interaction may be allowed.</p>
<p><strong>Prognosis:</strong> Improvements in overall esteem, mental
health, and wellness should also be seen as a main cause of anxiety is
removed. A level of sureness will hopefully be developed as the client
emerges from therapy and a more positive outlook on life may be a good
effect as well. As the therapist, or any other future doctor who would
take on this case, may we be hands-on and encouraging to Mr. Anderson
just like how we would be with clients that have similar feelings of
anxiety and fear.<br />
